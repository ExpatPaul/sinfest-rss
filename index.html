    <p>Hello. This is an unofficial RSS feed for <a href="http://sinfest.net/">Sinfest</a>.

    <p>As the feed file contains only the most recent comic, you should use an RSS reader that updates at least daily or some comics will be missing. The feed updates nightly 02:30 U.S. Pacific time (10:30 UTC, 09:30 UTC during U.S. summer time).</p>
