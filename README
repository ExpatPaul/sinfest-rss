Scrapes http://sinfest.net/ and creates an RSS feed of one item: 
the most recent comic.

Intended for use with RSS readers that update daily or more frequently,
as the RSS feed will not include comics older than the most recent one.

Use cron or similar to invoke the scraper daily.
Example crontab entry to run at 1 a.m. server time:
    # Run nightly
    0 1 * * * python /home/qviri/bin.piorkowski.ca/sinfest-rss/scrape.py

With small modifications (having scrape.py print feed.format_rss2_string()
rather than doing feed.format_rss2_file()) it would also be possible
to re-scrape sinfest every time RSS feed is checked, but this would
be at the expense of higher load on Sinfest's server and yours.
